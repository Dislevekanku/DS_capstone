# Investigating the impact of Butina Clustering on Virtual Screening Effectiveness for Drug Discovery

## Overview:

As part of my Master degree requirement, I completed this capstone project. My capstone project focuses on investigating the impact of Butina Clustering on Virtual Screening Effectiveness for Drug Discovery. The primary objective is to evaluate how clustering techniques can enhance the efficiency of virtual screening in identifying potential drug candidates, particularly for cancers with PIK3CA mutations. We employed a combination of computational methods and bioinformatics tools to address this problem.

## Abstract:

This project aims to assess the effectiveness of Butina Clustering in improving virtual screening outcomes for drug discovery, with a specific focus on PIK3CA-mutated cancers. By integrating artificial intelligence and clustering techniques, we sought to expedite the identification of potential drug candidates targeting PIK3CA mutations. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging clustering algorithms to streamline the virtual screening process, ultimately advancing drug discovery efforts in oncology.

## Introduction:

Accelerating drug discovery for PIK3CA-mutated cancers is imperative due to the lack of effective treatments for these conditions. Traditional drug discovery methods are often slow and costly, necessitating innovative approaches to expedite the process. Virtual screening coupled with clustering techniques presents a promising solution to overcome these challenges by efficiently prioritizing molecules for experimental testing.

## Methods:

Data integration involved selecting the PIK3CA target, acquiring bioactivity data, and obtaining compound structures from the ChemBL database. We performed virtual screening without clustering, followed by Butina clustering and subsequent virtual screening. The effectiveness of virtual screening was evaluated using enrichment plots to assess the proportion of active molecules identified within the screened dataset.

## Experimental Results:

Our experimental results demonstrated that Butina clustering had a negligible impact on virtual screening effectiveness. Enrichment factors obtained before and after clustering remained consistent, indicating minimal improvements in identifying active molecules. Visualizations such as enrichment plots effectively illustrated these findings.

## Analysis:

Interpreting the results revealed that Butina clustering did not significantly enhance virtual screening outcomes in our study. Despite expectations of improved efficiency, clustering techniques failed to yield substantial benefits. Potential limitations and unexpected findings were discussed, shedding light on the complexities of virtual screening workflows.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, our research highlights the limited effectiveness of Butina clustering in improving virtual screening for drug discovery in PIK3CA-mutated cancers. While clustering techniques offer computational advantages, their impact on screening outcomes may vary depending on the dataset and parameters employed. Future research should explore alternative clustering algorithms and parameters to optimize screening efficiency further.
